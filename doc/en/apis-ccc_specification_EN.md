# **2. Overview**

apis-ccc is client software for uploading information that is related to energy sharing to external services such as a server and downloading node configuration files from a server for operation and maintenance. It constructs clusters by using the functions of the Vert.x and Hazelcast frameworks to obtain information from apis-main that is running on multiple nodes that are connected via Ethernet or other communication lines. From the Grid Master in the cluster, it then obtains information on the hardware of each node, software information related to apis-main, and node-specific information. In that way, information on any node can be obtained. apis-ccc also has a function for downloading configuration files upon request from apis-main.

Figure 2-1

<br>

# **3. Software Composition**

## **3.1. Software Architecture**

The apis-ccc software architecture is illustrated in Figure 3-1. apis-ccc runs on two frameworks, the Vert.x event-driven load distribution platform and the Hazelcast in-memory distributed computing framework. Both frameworks run on top of the Java Development Kit (JDK) on Linux. (Operation has been confirmed on the OSS software version 12. Refer to the OSS license.)

Figure 3-1

<br>

## **3.2. .apis-ccc Services**

The four services provided by apis-ccc (Figure 3-2) are described below.

1)  Unit Data Reporting  
  This service collects information from Grid Master at regular intervals, including hardware information such as the DC/DC converter and battery of each node and software information that is related to apis-main, etc., and node-specific information. It sends that information to external services such as a server.

3)  Deal Reporting  
  This service collects information on total energy sharing from any Mediator Service and sends that information to external services such as a server. (The Mediator Service is selected by Vert.x.)

5)  Scenario Acquisition  
  This service collects scenario files from a server or other external services according to periodic accesses from apis-mains and sends the files to the requesting apis-mains.

4)  Policy Acquisition  
  This service collects policy files from a server or other external services according to periodic accesses from the apis-mains and sends the files to the requesting apis-mains.

# **4. Detailed Description of Actions**
    
## **4.1. Unit Data Reporting**

The Unit Data Reporting apis-ccc service sends requests via the event bus to Grid Master, which is a service of apis-main, at intervals of unitDataReporting.periodMsec to obtain software and hardware information for all nodes and node-specific information in JSON format. (See section 6.1, “config.json”.) The obtained information is sent in JSON format by the HTTP POST method to external services such as a server, where it is stored in a MongoDB database. (Concerning hardware information, see section 5.1, “Data Acquired by Unit Data Reporting”.)

![](media/media/image4.png)  
Figure 4-1

<br>

## **4.2. Deal Reporting**

The Deal Reporting apis-ccc service sends requests via the event bus to a Mediator Service, which is a service of apis-main, at intervals of dealReporting.periodMsec (see section 6.1, “config.json”) to obtain energy sharing data in JSON format. The obtained information is sent in JSON format by the HTTP POST method to external services such as a server, where it is stored in MongoDB. (The Mediator Service is specified by Vert.x. It obtains all energy sharing data from memory that is shared with Hazelcast and sends the data to the Deal Reporting service.)

Separately from the periodic Deal Reporting processing, the Mediator Services of the participating apis-mains apply a trigger when the energy sharing is completed to execute processing that saves the energy sharing completion data to the MongoDB database via the Deal Reporting service.

![](media/media/image5.png)  
Figure 4-2

<br>

## **4.3. Scenario Acquisition**

The apis-ccc Scenario Acquisition service receives requests for scenario files from the Scenario Keeping service of the apis-main User Service via the event bus at intervals specified in the scenario files. The requests are sent together with the service ID and other such information. The Scenario Acquisition service that has received the request sends that information to a server or other such external service by the HTTP POST method. The service that receives the information matches the ID and other information and returns a scenario file in JSON format in the HTTP POST response to the Scenario Acquisition service. Upon receiving the response, the Scenario Acquisition service sends the scenario file in JSON format to the requesting Scenario Keeping service via the event bus.

![](media/media/image6.png)  
Figure 4-3

<br>

## **4.4. Policy Acquisition**

The apis-ccc Policy Acquisition service receives requests for scenario files from the Policy Keeping service of the apis-main User Service via the event bus at intervals specified in the Policy files. The requests are sent together with the service ID and other such information. The Policy Acquisition service that has received the request sends that information to a server or other such external service by the HTTP POST method. The service that receives the information matches the ID and other information and returns a scenario file in JSON format in the HTTP POST response to the Policy Acquisition service. Upon receiving the response, the Policy Acquisition service sends the scenario file in JSON format to the requesting Policy Keeping service via the event bus. Because the same policy file must be used for the entire cluster, it is necessary to prevent changes to the policy file by the apis-main programs of different nodes. For that reason, it is implemented as a function, and the administrator must temporarily halt automatic interchange within the cluster and perform it as a maintenance task.

## **6.2. cluster.xml**

This file contains the parameter settings that are required for construction of Hazelcast clusters in XML format (cluster name, password, network settings, multicast settings, etc.).

The file is encrypted for storage as cluster.xml.encrypted.

<br>

## **6.3. logging.properties**

This file contains settings that are related to log output of the standard java.util.logging API (log file location, log capacity, logging level, etc.).

<br>

## **6.4. start.sh**

This shell script is executed automatically to start up apis-ccc when the OS boots up.  
The command in start.sh that starts up apis-ccc is shown below.  

<br>

 > java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Duser.timezone=Asia/Tokyo -Djava.util.logging.config.file=./logging.properties -jar ./apis-ccc-2.23.0-a01-fat.jar -conf ./config.json -cp ./ -cluster -cluster-host 127.0.0.1 &  

<br>

The arguments that follow ‘java’ in the command are explained below.  

* Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true  
 \-\> Option for binding to an IPv4 address

* Duser.timezone=Asia/Tokyo  
 \-\> Time zone setting

* Djava.util.logging.config.file=./logging.properties  
 \-\> Option for specifying the log configuration file

* jar ./apis-ccc-2.23.0-a01-fat.jar

 \-\> Option for specifying the local IP Address

<br>

## **6.5. stop-kill.sh**

This file holds a shell script that stops execution of the apis-ccc process.  
After executing the shutdown function (stop) via the event bus, the script forcefully terminates its own Java process when a timeout occurs. The timeout time can be set in units of seconds within the script.  

<br>

## **6.6. key.pem**

This is the secret key used for SSL protection of the event bus.

<br>


## **6.7. cert.pem**

This is the certificate used for SSL protection of the event bus.

<br>

# **7. Logging Functions**
    
## **7.1.Log Level**

The standard Java java.util.logging API is used for logging. Of the seven available log levels described below, the “CONFIG” and “FINER” levels are not used for APIS. The APIS operation logs are described in the logging.properties file, where the log file location, log levels, maximum log size, and maximum number of logs are set.

\[java.util.logging Log Level\]

1.  SEVERE
  * This level is used when an execution error occurs.  
   Log output at this level can be considered an indication that a problem has occurred.  
     * \< Example \> 
       * Communication with an external server has failed.

2.  WARNING
  *  This level is used to issue a warning when there is unexpected behavior that is not an execution error.  
     *  \< Example \> 
        *  The hardware data on each node in the response from the Grid Master is empty.

3.  INFO
  *  This level is used to output information during normal execution. For apis-ccc, it is used when event processing that is particularly important to operation is performed.
     *  \< Example \> 
        *  Connection information for a server or other external service

4.  CONFIG
  *  This level relates to configuration settings, but is not output for apis-ccc.

6.  FINE
  *  This level is used for output of ordinary operation information during normal system operation.
     *  \< Example \> 
        *  Information to be sent to a server or other external services

6.  FINER
  *  This level is for information related to the starting and stopping of specific processes, but is not output for apis-ccc.

8.  FINEST
  *   This level is used for output of ordinary operation information during normal system operation.
      *   \< Example \> 
          *   When Vert.x Verticle is started up, etc.

<br>

## **7.2. Output Destinations of APIS Action Logs**

The apis-ccc operation logs are output to three destinations: UDP, console, and file. The log output destinations and output levels can be set in the logging.properties file. UDP is used for security of data output to the communication line and line traffic. Output to file should be considered for the capacity of non-volatile storage.

# **8. Error Handling**

When a problem occurs, the log is output to file, UDP, and console, but there is no function for the process to reset or stop itself.

<br>

# **9. Security**
    
## **9.1. Inter-APIS Communication Security**

The apis-ccc and the Grid Master communicate via the event bus and Hazelcast communication supported by the Vert.x and Hazelcast frameworks. For security, communication by both methods is encrypted by the methods listed below.

(1) Event bus communication

* SSL public-key cryptography (RSA)
* SSL self-signed certificate

(2) Hazelcast communication

* Shared-key cryptography (128-bit AES)

<br>

# **10. Privacy**

It is necessary to check whether or not the information that can be obtained via apis-ccc is personal information, because what is considered to be personal information varies with the region of introduction. Caution is required, because the act of sending personal information to an external server without the permission of the information owner may be subject to personal information protection regulations such as GDPR.

<br>

# **11. OPEN-SOURCE Software Licenses**

The software used by apis-ccc and the relevant open-source software licensing information is listed in the table below. Because Adopt OpenJDK is used by apis-ccc only as a linked library, it is not necessary to open the apis-ccc source code, even under GPL v2 with Classpath Exception applied. For the other software, also, no license requires the apis-ccc source code to be published.
